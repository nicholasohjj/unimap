Visual analysis is accompanied by an investigation into the shifts in materials, technologies and contexts of display and consumption, which often expressed British control, native resistance and a desire for self-rule. The course also considers the role of British institutions, namely, art schools, archaeological surveys, museums and exhibitions in grooming art production and tastes; native projects and responses are unravelled simultaneously to understand East-West interactions.', 4);

Every day, we make many decisions. However, are you aware that we all possess cognitive biases that influence our choices without us knowing? These natural biases can lead us into making seemingly prudent decisions that are illogical. 
 
In this module, we will explore some of the biases that we are naturally programmed. You will understand why we don’t even realize that we behave irrationally and make choices that are unintended.  
 
With a better knowledge of these inherent natural biases, we can think more clearly and make better decisions in our lives.', 2);
